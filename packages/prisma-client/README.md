# Overview [:house:](../../README.md#Challenge) {#Overview}

This client is an SPA allowing to test the result of your implementation.

This client has been created in order to make the test finished within 3 hours but there are defininitely some improvements to make at any level.

<br /><br />

# Acceptance criteria

Your solution has to produce the same previews for the Button component.

!!! info For the design and components to build that client, it is up to you to keep the existing or do your own. Of course, more you do more you can convince us you are the right fit for the company.

## Improvments

Explain your choices and anything you would have to do but did not have time

`I was able to complete the assessment. I liked the way the project structure was built and initially took some time to understand the whole data flow through the application. I have created a constant theme file and an individual themed-component for the solution to work. The useContext hook was a bit troubling with the cloneElement method. Found a work around but need to improve that to use the context value directly. I would have added test cases had time permitted me, Overall the application was great to work with.`
